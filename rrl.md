# Design, fabrication, modeling and control of an Origami Haptic Platform

*This project was made in collaboration with Mustafa Mete and Prof. Jamie Paik at the Reconfigurable Robotics Lab*.

Robogamis are lightweight, flexible and robust structures. They are made of rigid tiles and flexible hinges. Like a paper origami, they allow by design only certain movements. They can be passive or actuated. 

In this project, I designed, built and actuated a haptic robogami controller for VR. 
- actuated robogamis are well suited for haptics
- 3 DOF, roll pitch and yaw
